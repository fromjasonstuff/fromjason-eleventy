<h1>Patreon's new logo design is good actually</h1>
<p><em>From <a href="https://reddit.com/r/logodesign/s/lg2YiEhKHg">my post</a> in <a href="https://reddit.com/r/logodesign/s/hsCkbDSw17">r/logodesign</a></em></p>
<p><img src="/img/images/patreon-logo.png" alt="Patreon logo"></p>
<p>Patreon is the latest brand to get dragged by the internet for its new logo design. At the risk of catching a few strays, I'm here to defend it, just a bit, especially in the context of this sub.</p>
<p>Is the logo marking basically just a blob? Yes. Is the <a href="https://news.patreon.com/articles/patreon-redesigned">accompanying philosophy</a> maybe a little pretentious and wacky? For sure. It reminds me of Pepsi's logo <a href="https://www.goldennumber.net/wp-content/uploads/pepsi-arnell-021109.pdf">rebrand doc</a></p>
<p>But the Patreon logo is fundamentally a good design, in my opinion (which I try my best to form using guidance from great logo designers). Here's why:</p>
<p>It's identifiable, scalable, and highly adaptable.</p>
<p><strong>Identifiable:</strong> The marking is as simple and solid as possible without feeling ambiguous. We might see a kidney bean now, but that will pass. Over the years, the marking will be unmistakably &quot;Patreon.&quot; Same with the custom(?) lettermark. It complements the marking but is distinct enough to stand on its own.</p>
<p>I see so many designs here that first aim to be clever, adding unnecessary ornamentation at the expense of recall ability.</p>
<p><strong>Scaleable</strong>: When I think of scaleability, I think of the Twitter logo. You can tell that the designers <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1683266038602010624.html">worked hard</a>on keeping its shape when small. Patreon's marking, lettermark, and combination mark are identifiable at any size. The marking will even look good as a favicon (32x32). How many logos can claim that?</p>
<p><strong>Adaptable:</strong> Patreon's <a href="https://www.patreon.com/brand">brand guide</a> covers multiple use cases for its logo. All work well. Adaptability is primarily dependent on the first two points above. For example, the ability to use the logo as a marking, icon, lettermark, and combo mark without losing its identity means it'll adapt to any medium, from an app icon to a billboard.</p>
<p>The logo also looks good monochromatic. I don't know what they're doing with the animated blob thing, but it doesn't lose any detail as a solid color. That's important for formats that restrict the use of color, or when the logo isn't the focal point of the marketing message.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Patreon's logo is just very different from the geometric outline shapes we're used to. It's solid and organic. It's anti-brutalist and anti-Scandinavian (design style, not the people.)
Maybe it's the start of a whole new design era. Who knows. Organic shapes and ornamentation are already popping up on website designs.</p>
<p>None of this is to say that personal taste doesn't account for anything. A logo can be fundamentally &quot;correct&quot; and still look ugly. Maybe that's the case with Patreon. But personally, if I'm aiming for anything in a design, it's the three things mentioned above. These are targets too important to miss.</p>
