Is this a blog or a digital garden? I'm working that out. For now, you can read about [how](/colophon/) I made this space.

## How to Commission a Logo Design: A Practical Guide for Non-Designers *(working title)*

[freelance.fromjason.xyz](/freelance/how-to-commission-a-logo-design-a-practical-guide-for-non-designers/)

If you're a freelancer starting your new business, you'll need a logo. The problem is most people don't know how to project manage a logo design. They are often left with designs that don't fit their needs and file formats they don't understand.

*How to Commission a Logo Design* series attempts to solve this problem. 

I'm posting the series to my [freelance blog](/freelance/) one part at a time. Figured that will push me to finish it finally.


## Curated List of Tools & Resources Every Freelancer Needs
[yearonefreelancer.gumroad.com](https://yearonefreelancer.gumroad.com/l/free-tools-for-freelancers)

I made this list for all year-one freelancers who want to save time and money using powerful tools that a fellow freelancer with ten years of experience curated.

## HyperKeeper
**(In production)**

An all-in-one toolkit for freelancers built in [Notion](http://notion.so). I am actively using HyperKeeper for my freelance work as I refine it. I plan to release version 1 by the winter.

*Tentative features include:*

1. Invoicing and Tracking
1.  Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
1. Project Management
1. Objectives Discovery
1. Focus Journals
1. "[Second Brain](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/)" designed for freelancers with ADHD

## Today Journal
**(In production)**

A daily journal that defeats *task dread* using habit, prioritization, and the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). I hope to launch this winter.
