# Colophon
This is my site's (abridged) *colophon*; a word I definitely knew before today. 

I'm still working on the full write-up, but I didn't want to keep the site up for too long without giving proper credits. So, here is the abridged version for now:

## Tom Chalky for typeface and graphics
The primary font is called [Volume](https://tomchalky.com/product/volume-handcrafted-trio-font-family/) TC and the secondary font is called Volume TC Sans. Both are handcrafted by [Tom Chalky](https://tomchalky.com). The graphics are mostly from old books that Tom vectorized and offers in different [illustration packages](https://tomchalky.com/product-category/illustrations/).

## Webflow for HTML and CSS
I made the design in [Webflow](https://webflow.com) and exported the site (HTML & CSS).

## 11ty for static site generation
[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) is a lightweight static site generator. I chopped up my HTML and used the [11ty starter template](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) called [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) as the structural foundation for the site.

## Netlify for hosting (and Github)
I use [Github](https://github.com) as my repository and linked it to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). When I commit a change in Github (like adding a post) it automatically updates my site.

## Digital Gardens for Ethos
I stumbled on the concept of digital gardens in Maggie Appleton's blog post *[A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)*.
