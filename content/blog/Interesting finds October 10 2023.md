# Interesting finds, October 10, 2023

A few things I stumbled upon last week. No theme. Just some cool stuff. 

**[Every Noise](https://everynoise.com/)**
Ever wonder what genre an artist belongs to? In an effort to categorize music and personalize playlists, Spotify "invented" a bunch of sub genres. Every Noise lets you enter an artist name and reveal the associated sub genres.  

**[First iPhone Impressions](https://daringfireball.net/2007/06/iphone_first_impressions)**
Noted Apple blogger and Markdown inventor John Gruber writes about his experience with the first ever iPhone in 2007. 

**[Autonomy Online A Case For The IndieWeb](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/autonomy-online-indieweb/)**
Name says it all. Good write up. 

**[Twitter founder Jack Dorsey tweets his love for the stock Notes app on iOS](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1012428138326851585) (2018)**
Nothing wrong with using notes but, I never felt the urge to evangelize Apple's most neglected bloatware. Jack seems to love it. Good for him. Maybe he can write an apology in it for selling twitter to a child. 

**[Publishing to 11ty with iA Writer and Micropub](https://george.mand.is/2023/05/publishing-to-11ty-with-ia-writer-and-micropub/)**
I am *this* close to building a custom blog. I've done a ton of research to find a good static blog framework and [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) seems to be a favorite among bespoke bloggers. Here's what appears to be a great tutorial (haven't done it yet) that explains how to set up an 11ty-powered blog and post directly from [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). It's exactly what I want to do so I'm excited to try it.
