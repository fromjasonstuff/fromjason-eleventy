Things I stumbled upon on the internet last week. I've been into guides and manifestos lately, so here's a few I loved. <!--more-->

**[A credible threat to (and from) commercial social network silos/1](http://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/credible-threat-1/)**
Case against Facebook joining the Fediverse (ActivityPub). I like this essay because it touches on the concept of [Embrace, Enhance, Extinguish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish), a tactic Microsoft used in the 90s to kill open source technology.

**[King of the Hill Animation Style Guide](https://imgur.com/a/PiJLk)**
A detailed best practices for animators of the show. A fascinating peek into all the work that goes into animating a classic tv show. 

**[The Website Obesity Crisis](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm)**
I can never get enough manifestos against what I like to call *"flash and trash"* web design. 

**[Designers Against Monoculture](https://designmanifestos.org/noah-scalin-designers-against-monoculture/)**
Fight against corporate design sensibilities. Even has a badge you can display on your website.

**[Taco Bell Programming](https://every.sdf.org/US_ASCII/Geekish/various/taco_bell.txt)**
Interesting and succinct philosophy.
