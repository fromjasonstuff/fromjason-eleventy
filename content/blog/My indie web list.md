# My Indie Web list

[Jump to the list](#the-list)

At night before bed, I'll bounce around the indie web for a couple hours. Along the way, I'll bookmark a website, or three, or throw one into to my RSS reader. 

Maybe I like the person's site design, or I enjoyed a piece they wrote, or whatever. I'm just trying to build a feed that lives outside of social media. 

But, the next time I open my RSS feed, I have no idea who these people are and what they're doing there. Why did I take the time to save them?

So, this is my half-assed attempt to make note of what I thought was so interesting about said person.

For now, I'm embedding [a Raindrop collection](https://raindrop.io/JayVee/indie-web-38881876). At the moment, there's too much friction between my writing app and publishing a post here (I'm still settling into my new site). I don't see myself posting each time I bookmark. 

This temporary process is not ideal either. I'll have to add a site to Reeder, then add it again to Raindrop with a note. That's way too many steps. We'll see how it goes. Maybe I'll write an iOS Shortcut or something. 

## The List
This list is for personal websites I add to my RSS reader while researching the indie web. Each entry will (should?) have a note to remind me why I added the site.
