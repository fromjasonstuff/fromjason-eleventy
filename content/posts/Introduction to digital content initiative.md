It started in the summer— this nagging sense that what I create doesn't belong to me. My Tiktoks, Tweets, Medium posts, Substack newsletters, Instagram stories, etcetera— those are all *my* creations. I was in the room when I made'em. So why does it all feel inaccessible?

After some reflection, I learned something about my creative approach. I wasn't posting the things I made, I was making things to post. 

I wrote *in* Medium. I recorded *in* TikTok. Not because it necessarily easier to create in a clumsy video editor. I did it out of habit. I did it because that's what I've been trained me to do. In-app creation became my creative workflow. As a result, I accepted a sort of second-class ownership for my creations. 

That framing is not accidental. Social media platforms want us creating content specifically for them. They want our ownership to feel estranged. 

The feeling was inescapable. Even while writing in a simple word processor I paid monthly to use. *Why couldn't I see my files outside the context of the app I made them in?*

From an unpublished rant:

> For each new sentence I write in Ulysses, I dig myself deeper into a hole I pay monthly to occupy. Each additional draft, is that much more effort to climb out if I wanted something new. And recently, I've had the itch climb out like an injured Batman in *The Dark Knight Rises*. Because, I'm starting to question the wisdom of paying five bucks in perpetuity for a glorified text file generator. One that won't save my writings to a local folder by default. 

Ok. That was a little melodramatic. Perhaps I was also working through some misplaced frustration. Ulysses is hardly the biggest culprit. Nonetheless, I moved back to iA Writer. And now, I'm on a mission. 

This initiative is my first pass at reclaiming ownership over the digital stuff I make. Through the fall. I've laid the foundation for an independent presence on the web. I created a custom site on a custom domain where I can publish my writings *first*. 

To my surprise, I'm not the only one out there who felt trapped in digital silos. Some would label the space I've made as part of the small web, or the indie web. 

Whatever you call it, I'm in.
