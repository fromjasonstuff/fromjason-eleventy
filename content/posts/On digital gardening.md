# {{ title }}

When I stumbled on the concept of digital gardens, it lit up my brain[^1]. It gave me a framework for something I've long tried (and failed) to accomplish with my previous blogs.


My failures weren't always related to technical limitations. Though, I see now how chronological order blogs can [stifle](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/) creative exploration. 

> The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.
—[My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) by Joel Hooks

It had more to do with a lack of permission to post anything that wasn't a stellar 1,500 word think-piece. The idea of retroactively altering my post almost felt deceptive, or even criminal. It was as if my words were evidence to a crime, and the Twitter police would break my door down if I tampered with it. 

Now that I have permission, and a solid framework, my vision for this project is clear, and I'm excited to [get started](https://fromjason.xyz).

I do worry that my ADHD brain will get caught up in too much "pruning" and not enough "planting". 

I'd like to get rhythm going for my garden— *plant-plant-prune, plant-plant-prune.*

### Three phases for my notebook entries:

1. *Note*: my initial knee-jerk thoughts on a subject. 
2. *Concept*: a more polished and intentional write-up, with research any additional developments since my note. 
3. *Essay*: An exhaustive exploration on the subject. Maybe with graphics and illustrations. 
4. *Dead*: Maybe a different, less ominous word. For a "dead" note I could even have a "petition to revive" in the form of comments or direct emails. Oh, I like this. 

Structure inspired by [Maggie Appleton's Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). 

Do I keep the same page for all three phases, or start a new page and link to it? 


## Some unstructured thoughts on structure

I'm going all in with [write.as](https://write.as/about) for my digital garden. There are some obvious limitations (bi-directional linking, categorizing, etc.) but that's part of the appeal. 

I'd like a way to distinguish my external and internal hyperlinks. I think it'll keep the reader oriented. Using CSS and JavaScript for different colors seems like a potential solution. 

[^1]: I will expand on this soon. Also, made this ref just to test the ref feature for 11ty and markdown.

### Bookmarks
I made a public bookmark collection for Digital Gardens on Raindrop.io where I'll add anything I find interesting.
