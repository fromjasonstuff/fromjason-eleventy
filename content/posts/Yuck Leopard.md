Did a creep just offer to buy you a drink? Yuck Leopard will casually walk by with a perfectly timed "yuck,” just loud enough for them to hear it.

All Yuck Leopard asks is you send this page to 10 people so they, too, can cause psychological harm to people who quote Andrew Tate unirioncially.

If you don't send this page to 10 people, Yuck Leopard will confess their love for you five years into your platonic friendship. And when you reject their advances, Yuck Leopard will start posting Coldplay song lyrics to their Threads. And not new, pop-y Coldplay either. Parachutes Coldplay. The real depressing shit.
