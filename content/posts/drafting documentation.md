Unfinished notes and incomplete thoughts for my [digital content initiative series](https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/freelance/s/digital-content-initiative/).

#### Attempt to define `phase` values
Identifies how "polished" the concept is. The phase value options are also loosely defined at the moment. I need to flush out a better system. 

1. Sorting (and assembling)
2. Matching (and fitting)
3. Assembling (with interlocking)
4. Deconstructing 

1. Aligning: When putting a puzzle together, you align the edges and shapes of the pieces to ensure they fit together correctly.
2. Matching: This involves finding and matching similar patterns, colors, or shapes on adjacent puzzle pieces.
3. Fitting: As you work on the puzzle, you aim to find the correct placement and fit for each piece within the larger picture.
4. Assembling: This refers to the act of putting the puzzle pieces together to form the complete picture.
