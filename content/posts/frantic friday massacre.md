From [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2023/11/18/openai-memo-altman-firing-malfeasance-communications-breakdown):
> Sam Altman's firing as OpenAI CEO was not the result of "malfeasance or anything related to our financial, business, safety, or security/privacy practices" but rather a "breakdown in communications between Sam Altman and the board," per an internal memo from chief operating officer Brad Lightcap seen by Axios.

So why the spectacle? Why the [melodramatic press release](https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition) and thoughtless communication with investors? Why not wait for the markets to close? What was *so* pressing that forced such a clumsy public execution?

I will not shed a tear for Altman or Microsoft. I could give a shit about wealthy stakeholders, either. But the circumstances surrounding this Friday night massacre make the board's decision feel increasingly frantic and ill-advised. 

Am I missing something? I'm nothing approaching an expert in any of this, so I'm likely neglecting some apparent considerations. 

Or, perhaps, start-up board members tend to [lean towards petulance](https://reactionwheel.net/2021/11/your-boards-of-directors-is-probably-going-to-fire-you.html). 

I keep going back to the press release, where they sandwiched the firing between this statement:

> OpenAI was deliberately structured to advance our mission: to ensure that artificial general intelligence **benefits all humanity**. 

Big "if god is for us, who could be against us" vibes. Emphasis mine. 

Whatever's going on, it feels icky. Historically, shadowy coups with populous justifications have a tendency *not* to benefit all of humanity.
