# This event was shot on iPhone and edited on Mac

Just finished watching Apple's Scary Fast Event[^1]. Cook & Co. announced a new MacBook Pro, updated iMac, and the M3 chip family (M3, Pro, Ultra). Pretty standard stuff, if not a little light on substance. I'm not complaining. They can't all have "*one more thing*" energy. 

But there was something at the end I hadn't noticed before in previous events. Did you catch it? On the last slide of the presentation, there was a message under the Apple logo: *"This event was shot on iPhone and edited on Mac."*

That's a pretty impressive claim when you think about it. A trillion dollar company used a smartphone camera to shoot its infomercial. Wild stuff. 

Anyway, here are some press photos from the event with a screen shot of the message at the bottom.

The Space Black MacBook Pro looks dope. It's almost time for an upgrade too...

You know what?

I wrote and posted this article from my iPhone, come to think of it.

And then I downloaded the images from Apple's [press release](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-unveils-new-macbook-pro-featuring-m3-chips) and uploaded to my server, all without opening a laptop.

I wish we had Universal healthcare...
