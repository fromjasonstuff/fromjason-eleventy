To meet my goals, I'll need software willing to keep my files accessible in open formats. This realization came while testing a novel presentation app called iA Writer. 

From my post [On iA Presenter and my mission to preserve my digital assets](https://fromjason.xyz/p/freelance/on-ia-presenter-and-my-mission-to-preserve-my-digital-assets/): 

> The tools we use to create should bend to our creations, not the other way around. Our creations (writing, photos, graphics, code, etc.) should exist independently, free to move around, reshape, and repurpose. If an app can't respect that, I don't want it.

### iA Writer
iA Writer is the hub for writing collection. It's my primary word processing tool and where I store my master files. 

- Saves files in `.txt` in `.md` formats 
- Files are visible in an iCloud app folder by default. 
- Rich exporting features: HTML, Rich Text, plain text, MS Word and more. 
- Supports open source standards like micropub. 
- Offers non-subscription purchase option. 

### iA Presenter
While a version 1 app, iA Presenter is my primary presentation tool. I'm working on converting my presentation collection to Markdown format for easy presentation creation. 

- Saves files in `.txt` in `.md` formats 
- Files are visible in a folder of my choosing by default. 
- Rich exporting features: HTML, Rich Text, MS PowerPoint (beta) and more. 
- Offers non-subscription purchase option. 

### Eleventy (11ty) 
Eleventy is wonderful a static site generator that I use for my blog, From Jason. 11ty allows me to design a site structure I want and use a wide variety of file formats. 

- Open source.
- Uses established technology like JavaScript. 
- Processes posts in markdown or plain text.
- Easy to port my writing files elsewhere if needed. 
- Generous licensing and free to use.
- Large community of supporters and contributors. 

### Micro.blog (experimental)

### Open standards built on Indie Web tenets
