This [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/s/FSydExW52w), an ode to early Madonna, has 505 upvotes as of the time of writing this note. But the seemingly ￼innocuous ￼collection of Madonna photos from the late 70s and early 80s feels *off*. Particularly photos 7 and 8, where Madonna's face gives an almost uncanny valley feel. Maybe it's the extra arm coming from Madonna's torso in pic 8. 

Here's an actual photo of young Madonna from the collection:

And here's the AI-generated photos that made its way into the Reddit post:

The redditor who posted the collection claims to not have noticed that two of the dozen photos were fake:

> I just googled "Madonna in the 80s"
> 
> Sorry I am not an expert at detecting AI, but you are acting like I'm deliberately deceiving people.
> 
> I'm not.

I believe them, which makes this situation that much more unsettling. 

Google is just throwing AI generated photos into the pile with all the authentic photos. No disclaimers. 

History is already warped thanks to the internet. I can't see how AI helps the situation. 

Unrelated, Madonna is a babe.
