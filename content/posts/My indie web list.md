# My Indie Web list

Note 12/10/2023: I am in thr process of revamping my bookmarks and curation. if you came here hoping for a big list of cool sites, you'll want to come back in a couple days. Id say Monday. I have some fun stuff I'm finishing up. For now, most of my lists are disabled. 

At night before bed, I'll bounce around the indie web for a couple hours. I used to spend that time on TikTok, but I've slowly moved away from trad-social for a few months now. 

Along the way, I'll bookmark a website, or three, or throw one into to my RSS reader. I love it! I find new, interesting people all the time. Each for a different reasons. 

Maybe I like the person's site design, or I enjoyed a piece they wrote, or whatever. I'm just trying to build a feed that lives outside of Meta and TikTok, you know?

But, the next time I open Reeder, and I see a site I add just the day before, I have no idea who these people are and what they're doing here. Why did I take the time to save them? Reeder doesn't seem to have an annotation feature so I never jot down a reason. 

So, this is my half-assed attempt to make note of what I thought was so interesting about said person.

For now, I'm embedding a Raindrop collection called [Indie Web](https://raindrop.io/JayVee/indie-web-38881876). I'd to post natively but at the moment, there's too much friction between my writing app and publishing here (I'm still settling into my new site). I don't see myself posting each time I bookmark. 

This temporary process is not ideal either. I'll have to add a site to Reeder, then add it again to Raindrop with a note. That's way too many steps. We'll see how it goes. Maybe I'll write an iOS Shortcut or something. 

## The List
This list is for personal websites I add to my RSS reader while researching the indie web. Each entry will (should?) have a note to remind me why I added the site.
