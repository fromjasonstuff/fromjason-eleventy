Outlined objectives for the [digital content initiative series](https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/freelance/s/digital-content-initiative/)

My primary objectives are to convert all writing files into archival formats (txt, md), and consolidate the collection into single iCloud folder (iA Writer app folder). I then want to design a process to maintain my collection using the principles outlined in this document. I hope to preserve my collection of personal and professional writing that outlives me and Microsoft Word. 

### Single-folder file system

Eliminating sub-folders as a method for file organization requires strong sort and filter capabilities (so I can find my files). I must standardize my files' metadata using a well-defined keys and values (see front matter). This standardization requires a strong understanding of my writing workflow and other patterns. 

### Normalized file formats

I want everything in text and markdown file formats— articles, posts, guides, presentations, speeches, diary entries, documentation, stories, poems, and grocery lists. 

Okay, maybe not grocery lists. 

### Benefits 


1. Strong sense of ownership for the things I write. 
2. Better preservation of my writing collection. Text files will outlive proprietary file formats, and preserve text in its natural state. 
3. Improved portability in and out of various platforms— blogs, presentation software, etc. My writing no longer feels "trapped" in Word, PowerPoint, or Ulysses. 
4. Improved ability to repurpose my guides, presentations, and other standardized copy. My bio preserved in a markdown file can export into virtually any format— HTML, Rich Text, plain text, PDF— then reused for websites, social media profiles, guest speaker panels, etc. 

## Challenges
Identified challenges to meeting my goals. This list is unfinished and will likely grow. 

### Digital sprawl
My files are currently scattered across iCloud Drive, local directories, and multiple platform silos on the web. Remembering a file's location, or even its existence, is a challenge. 

### Unchecked file formatting 
My writing collection lacks a common file format. Since I have no deliberate methods for maintaining a "master file," some of my writings are "trapped" in closed file formats like `.pages`, `.ppt`, `.pdf`, and other internet silos. I think I even have something in Sharepoint from a decade ago. 

### Curating the right technology 

(Work in progress)

### I like shiny things
Perhaps the largest contributor to my problem is me. I love a good writing app. Give me a polished UI and a few novel features, and you can have all my data. I don't have a plan to combat this behavior just yet, but I'm thinking about it.
