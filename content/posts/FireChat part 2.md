Yesterday, I published a note, [FireChat was a tool for revolution. Then it disappeared](https://fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/firechat-was-a-tool-for-revolution-then-it-disappeared/). That statement still stands today, but the circumstances surrounding FireChat’s disappearance have only been made stranger after an anonymous Hacker News comment.

From the [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40205375):

> Hi there, I am on developement team of Newnode, a successor of FireChat founded by two of the same people (https://www.newnode.com/). We now provide both, a VPN and a Messenger, with purpose to help people evade censorship and enable device-to-device connectivity. You can find the source code at https://github.com/clostra/newnode

This is great news, right? FireChat lives on! It was all just a silly misunderstanding. NewNode is FireChat’s successor. The end. Happily ever after, and whatnot. 

But wait a minute. Why didn’t FireChat users know about NewNode back in 2020, when FireChat closed? Was there no effort to preserve FireChat’s user base? I’m just a simple country developer, but would it not have been beneficial to maintain FireChat’s momentum? Last I heard, Open Garden, FireChat’s now-defunct parent company, was building a [massive mesh network](https://archive.ph/sUPif) for an entire country. Every major news blog in the world couldn’t shut up about it. 

And, forgiving me for prying, but did NewNode’s parent company, Clostra, [receive a $6.1 million dollar grant](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/512110-00) from the Department of Defense in January 2021? One year after FireChat shut down? How do you get one of those?

I have more questions than answers, unfortunately. But here’s what we do know so far. 

It turns out that NewNode isn’t FireChat’s immediate successor. No, NewNode is the *second* rebrand for the peer-to-peer messaging app. FireChat’s true successor was an app called Fireside. Don’t try to google it, though. The term “Fireside chat” only brings up the famous radio speeches by Franklin Roosevelt.

Clostra’s Fireside marketing choices get weirder. 

The [press release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fireside-messenger-offers-secure-and-private-connection-regardless-of-network-conditions-301387782.html) announcing Fireside was published in September 2021, a full year *after* FireChat mysteriously closed down. In the announcement published to PR Newswire, “FireChat” was not mentioned once. FireChat’s parent company, Open Garden, was not listed either. It makes sense, then, why every major news blog ignored what I’d imagine to be a newsworthy story. What I don’t understand is why Fireside wouldn’t want the world to know that FireChat was back and better than ever?

The other thing I find odd is the state of the old websites. If NewNode is FireChat’s successor, why not forward the [FireChat](http://firech.at) and [Open Garden](https://opengarden.com) websites to NewNode or Clostra? Six million tax dollars and you can’t find a decent IT person?
