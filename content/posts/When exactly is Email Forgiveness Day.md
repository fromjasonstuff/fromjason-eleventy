I remember it being April 30th. In fact, I'm [sure of it](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/30/email-debt-forgiveness-day-unread-inbox-). But, Gimlet Media, the company that produced the podcast where the holiday was invented [says](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/posts/edfd) Email Forgiveness Day is September 30th. Today. 


Gimlet is the first on the search results for the phrase "Email Forgiveness Day." The second is [this website](https://emaildebtforgiveness.me) that has what appears to be a direct quote from Alex Goldman (one of the inventors of the holiday):

> If there’s an email response you’ve wanted to send but been too anxious to send, you can send it on **September 30th**, without any apologies or explanations for all the time that has lapsed. It doesn’t matter how long it’s been. Just include a link to this explainer, the one you’re reading right now, so that your recipient knows what’s going on. Together, we can all make our inboxes less stressful.

Emphasis *their's*.

The attribution then links back to the Gimlet page, which doesn't mention Goldman at all.

I am vaguely aware of the Reply All controversy a couple years back. Could that have something to do with it? I don't know enough to have an opinion. But, changing the date seemingly without acknowledging it seems ~~weird~~ . I'll go with *thoughtless*. 

Below the first and second search results are pages of old articles referencing the April 30th date for Email Forgiveness Day. 

*Which day is it?* I need to be forgiven.
