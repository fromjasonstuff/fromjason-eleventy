Someone at the bar explaining the nuanced differences between long-form and short-form improv? That-Look Lion will shoot you over, well, that look. You'll get just the right amount of validation to remedy that deep discomfort.

All That-Look Lion asks is you send this page to 10 people so they, too, may roll their eyes at a theatre kid with a trusted friend.

If you don't send this page to 10 people, That-Look Lion will gaslight you. Hard. They'll give you that look for nice things, like when your dad hugs you. Trust me, it may not sound so bad, but that look eventually burrows into your soul.
