# {{ title }}

I stayed up late last night searching for the "old web"— personal homepages, digital gardens, manifestos, guides— the type of stuff FAANG buried under algorithms and shiny interfaces. 

And boy, did I find some stuff.

The old web is alive and, well, its alive at least. I have a bucket-full of bookmarks I have to sort through but, I'd like to post them here soon, under some undecided context. 

*Update:* this is now a growing list of sites from the old web. 

## Various sites from the old web
Some of these sites haven't been updated in decades, some are still updated regularly. 

1. There was [Tigerden's Big Page of Furry Links](http://www.tigerden.com/Sites/furlinks.html), which delivers exactly what it promises (I wouldn't click on the links in that list, though. The site is twenty years old, who knows where those URLs go to now). 

1. There's the [Project Xanadu](https://xanadu.com) page from the folks who *invented* the concept of hyperlinks (jump-links to them). They're snarky and stubborn in their philosophy. I love it. Here's a 1995 article from Wired about their story titled *[The Curse of Xanadu](https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/)*. Good read.

1. [Stinkymeat](http://www.stinkymeat.net/stinkymeat/day1/)— A well documented three week prank. 

1. [Internet Explorer is Evil](http://toastytech.com/evil/)— haven't read the entire site but I vibe with its premise. Wonder though if sites like this were a precursor to the Bill Gates micro-chip conspiracy theories?

1. [The Internet Pizza Server](https://beej.us/pizza/) is a charming little oddity. Here's the [pizza I ordered](https://i.snap.as/N6AkQ0Vt.jpg) with pepperoni, green peppers, and fingers.

1. A [forum discussing 9/11](https://www.metafilter.com/10034/Plane-crashes-in-to-the-word-trade-center) as it was happening. Eerie and surreal stuff. *"I was on the "E" Train, which heads straight into the WTC, only seconds before the crash, when I decided to switch to the "R" Train (which avoids the WTC). I would probably still be stuck on the train now, and for hours afterwards."*

1. [The LoserUsers](http://rmitz.org/bbsloser.html)— I can't make heads or tails on what this site is in reference to.


## Special Interests

1. [Lost Parks](http://www.lostparks.com)— a page dedicated to all of Florida's lost tourist attractions. Started in 1997 and was updated as recent as 2015 from what I can tell

1. A brief history of [Psychological Operations](https://www.psywarrior.com/index.html) from a Desert Storm Vet. A fascinating read. I couldn't find any mention of the internet as an effective medium for PSYOPs, to give you an idea how old the site is.

1. ["Weird Al" Yankovic Homepage](http://www.com-www.com/weirdal/)


## Guides & Tutorials
Detailed instructions for accomplishing something.

1. [DIY Cellphone](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~mellis/cellphone/index.html) is a guide that literally shows you how to make your own cellphone, by a couple of MIT folks.

1. An old [HTML Tutorial](http://www-cdr.stanford.edu/~petrie/jumpidx.htm) from Stanford with a fun writing voice. "*...we'll share what we've learned over the months in the School of Hard Knocks. Of course, everything we tried worked...NOT!!*"

1. [Cold Water Reactor](http://boredmob.com/cm/coldwaterreactor/)

1. [The SECRET Guide to Computers](https://secretguide2pcs.tripod.com)
