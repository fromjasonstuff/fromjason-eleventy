Irate Ivan has a knack for working those dreaded customer service calls you've been putting off. Want to cancel your Hims subscription? Need to speak with a CVS pharmacist? How about asking your husband for a divorce? Irate Ivan will handle it all for you with grace.

All Irate Ivan asks is you send this page to 10 people so they may utilize Irate Ivan's god-given gift of gab.

If you do not send this page to 10 people, you'll force Irate Ivan to text political donation solicitations to your phone every day, each more desperate than the last, for the rest of your life. No replying "STOP” to get out of this one.
