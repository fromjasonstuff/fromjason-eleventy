**Part One: The zero-sum game**

Instagram's CEO Adam Mosseri has a new social media profile with 650,000 followers. No, not on Threads, *Mastodon*. The seemingly odd crossover is the result of a coordinated effort to [interpolate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation) the App Store’s hottest microblogging platform, Threads, using a niche open-source protocol, [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/). And this is happening *at the behest of Mark Zuckerberg*.

I'll get to the point— this situation is fucked. I spent the past week figuring out what Zuck's angle is here. What I found was compelling, if not infuriating. 

There’s much to cover, so I’ll break this up into two or three posts. But ultimately, all I want to answer is a couple questions:

1. Has Meta lured an unwittingly Mastodon into a zero-sum game by interpolating with Threads? 
2. And if so, can Mastodon win this game?

I’ll give you my opinion on the first question immediately— yes, I think Mastodon is engaged in a sort of zero-sum game with Meta[^1]. To what extent “Fediverse leaders” are aware of this game is something we’ll explore in a future post. But I’ll say I think the folks at Meta are well aware of what they’re doing. We’ll talk about that later, too. I’ll spend the rest of this post explaining why I think the answer to number two, is “no.”

*Side note: I wrote a blurb about my intentions[^2] with writing this series and defined how I'm using some possibly loaded terms[^3], if you want to read first*. 

Let’s get into it.

## To the victor go the spoils (probably)

What are the hypothetical prizes in a hypothetical game with only one hypothetical winner? I’ve identified two possible big scores. Perhaps there are more, but these two feel the most relevant at the moment. 

The first prize feels obvious— TwitterX’s user base (I’ll call it Twitter from here on out). As Twitter’s erosion continues, disenfranchised users will search for a new home. The three platforms they might consider are Threads, Mastodon, and BlueSky[^4]. 

The second, perhaps more abstract, prize is the ability to frame what ActivityPub, and therefore the “open web,” means for the average internet user, i.e., history is written by the victors and such.

### Prize 1: Twitter users

There’s a perception circulating the Fediverse that interpolating Threads with Mastodon lends credibility to ActivityPub’s mission for an open web. This clout will then, somehow, translate into more converted Mastodon users. 

I have found nothing to suggest this notion is anything more than hopeful thinking[^5]. What I did find, however, is a something that suggests that the *opposite* is true for both ActivityPub’s credibility and Mastodon’s growth.

*Kill Zone* studies anti-trust behavior against tech startups. It identifies early adopters, or “techies,” as playing a “crucial role in the success of an innovation.”

From *[Kill Zone, Sai Krishna Kamepalli, Raghuram G. Rajan, and Luigi Zingales, (2020)](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_WP_202019.pdf)*:

> Techies choose their favored platform mainly for its technical characteristics and have the incentive to uncover the underlying quality of each rival platform. The mass of early techie adopters, in turn, drives the adoption by ordinary non-techie customers for two reasons. First, the mass of techie adopters offers a signal about the fundamental quality improvement brought about by the new platform. Second, this mass creates a network externality for ordinary customers, who have to choose whether to adopt the new platform. 

The study then suggests that novel technology attracts early adopters, “techies.” The “normies,” for lack of a better term, will watch what “techies” do before deciding because moving costs are higher for non-technical users.

This behavior changes for both types of users when they believe a merger between the “entrant” platform and the “incumbent” platform is imminent[^6]. “Techies” no longer perceive value in the entrant’s platform once its flagship offering debuts on the incumbent’s platform. *Side note: that’s why Meta copies the features of small startups. But we’ll get to that in a later post.* “Normie” users are less inclined to bear the cost of moving if it is unnecessary. 

So, it is possible that for every Threads user who discovers Mastodon through Meta’s ActivityPub implementation and not through, say, Mastodon evangelists, the incentive for early adopters to make the switch *decreases*. 

Twitter’s “normie” users are then more inclined to migrate to Threads because that’s where the early adopter signal is strongest. Upon closer inspection, these users may feel a familiarity that Mastodon cannot compete. Threads’ steady flow of feature announcements will only entice Twitter users further. For remaining Twitter users where associating with Meta is, as a matter of principle, a dealbreaker, Mastodon is no longer a viable option. Such users will search for something new where early adopter signaling and familiarity are strongest (my money is on BlueSky[^7]). 

In short, the very thing Mastodonians hope for— credibility through corporate interpolation— would sooner kill the platform than help it grow.

## Prize 2: Defining ActivityPub and the open web

Until now, I’ve intentionally used “interpolation” to describe what Threads is doing to Mastodon. Get used to that word. I think Zuck, Mosseri, and Meta will favor “interpolation” over “federation” to [influence users’ perception](https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C051TLnud8U/) of what a typical interpolation will look like. I know this because, for one, I live and breathe. But also, Mark Zuckerberg is no stranger to the pursuits of multi-app connectivity.

Zuckerberg wants, and has tried to achieve, a Meta-exclusive suite of interpolated apps. I’ll go on a limb and say its for all the *opposite* reasons ActivityPub exists. Intertwining Instagram, Threads and Facebook, would make it harder to [break up Meta](https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1682732/breakup-isnt-the-answer-facebooks-zuckerberg-says) under anti-trust[^8]. 

From Casey Newton’s *[Why WhatsApp and Instagram are just names now](https://web.archive.org/web/20221206185804/https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton/issues/why-whatsapp-and-instagram-are-just-names-now-156738)*:

> If the Federal Trade Commission ever planned to compel Facebook to spin out WhatsApp and Instagram — a big if, I know — you can imagine the company explaining that there was no longer such a thing as “WhatsApp” or “Instagram.” Going forward, those names will refer only to their respective graphical user interfaces. Behind the curtain, there is only Facebook. It’s a characteristically savvy — and ruthless — move from Zuckerberg and his lieutenants.

Up until now, Meta (then Facebook) and its efforts to interpolate its suite of messaging apps [have been met with scrutiny](https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23988879/instagram-facebook-meta-cross-platform-messaging-discontinued-mid-december-2023) from the EU and US regulators. Lucky for Zuck, though, Mastodon can help him achieve his goal in a way that looks like he’s embracing the open web. Along the way, Meta gets to decide what ActivityPub is and isn’t to its billions of users. 

### Story time interlude 

Consider for a moment a successful Threads and Mastodon interpolation one year from today. Meta is happy, Mastodon is content, and the EU thinks it has a victory over the gatekeepers. Meta then announces, “Hey, why not add Instagram, too?” 

Another year or so passes, and Meta now has Threads and Instagram humming along on the “open-ish web”. Is it using ActivityPub as the underlying protocol? Who knows? But we’re having fun!

Mastodon is still alive, barely. It didn’t convert as many ex-Twitter users as fediverse leaders had hoped, and the Mastodon’s non-profit arm exhausted its cash reserves keeping up with the Joneses. Donations are a little light this year. But who's to say why.

Mastodon.social is no longer the largest instance. In fact, it’s not even in the top three. Mozilla is number one. A couple crypto bros out of Japan manage the second and third-largest servers. Both have recently blocked mastodon.social because of a dispute over new interpolated features. The VC-funded instances wanted all the cool new features that appear to work find across the Meta-suite, but somehow break on this side of ActivityPub.

Meta is like, “Yeah, bro, mastodon.social is *fucking up*. Between you an me, and The Verge, our users don’t love this limited feature set when interacting with that instance. Those guys aren’t even end-to-end encrypted like our WhatsApp interpolation with Signal. It uses the Matrix protocol, you know. Open-sourced, too. Does Mastodon hate Americans? What gives?”

A few months pass, *yada-yada-yada*, lobby budgets increase, *dut-da-dut-da-duh*, Meta plants some news stories[^9]. And then one day, *bam!* Threads and Instagram block mastodon.social over safety and security concerns. Mastodon’s non-profit goes belly up, and chaos ensues. Perhaps another non-profit, one more suited to Meta’s interests, will take the reins, who knows.

For the next six months, a "good faith” effort to encrypt ActivityPub “unfortunately” fails. Mosseri, who's now fully cosplaying a frontend "indie dev", convinces Congress to allow Instagram and Threads to interpolate with Messenger and WhatsApp, where it’s safe[^10].

*The end.*

## Conclusion: All you had to do was nothing 

Regardless of what you think Meta’s intentions are, the company needs ActivityPub to meet its objectives. Zuck could never convince BlueSky to let him hop on the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com). Dorsey is a jackass, but he’s not dumb. He knows when Meta knocks on the door, it's not to borrow an egg. It's a declaration of war.

Before Meta decided it needed ActivityPub, Mastodon had a hand it could play. Even if it wasn't a full house, it was *something*.

For folks who just lost their audience, Mastodon was an attractive option. It was the place you went if you wanted to keep your followers. For folks disenchanted by corporate media silos, Mastodon was a refuge. It was the place you went to get away from the big tech billionaires. 

Put another way, Mastodon’s strong anti-corporate narrative resonated with people. It had a beloved open web protocol to back it up. All it had to do was nothing— bide its time, polish that iOS app, and wait for some of Twitter’s *quarter billion* users to come to you. But Mastodon and the greater fediverse lost what made it intriguing the moment it shook hands with Meta. And now, it could lose everything the open web movement worked so hard to achieve.

I’ll see you at the next post. 

[^1]: I know, I’m playing fast and loose with the mathematical term [zero-sum game](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1998-99/game-theory/zero.html# ). My goal is to illustrate that there *will* be winners and losers here, and contrast that possibility with the “wait and see” crowd.

[^2]: My intentions— For the record, I was, and still am, vehemently opposed to Meta’s business practices. Before I wrote a word, I was suspicious that Meta was up to something. I was less sure about *what* that something could be and how Mastodon could avoid potentially negative consequences (Initially, I was thinking a user data play). I wrote below a good-faith, albeit partisan, case for why Mastodon, ActivityPub, and the greater “open web” could be headed for trouble. I wrote this series because I think the web is better with these three elements in tact.

[^3]: Terms I’ll use— When I say “Mastodon,” I mean the collective server instances running the Mastodon software. I recognize that “Mastodon” is not a single platform or company. If I mean a specific “instance,” I’ll use its name (i.e., mastodon.social). When I say “Fediverse,” I mean the collective group of people who spend time on ActivityPub-enabled platforms. “Fediverse leaders” are those who contribute to or participate in matters related to ActivityPub and have a following and an active voice in the community. 

[^4]: I don’t mean to discount [Spill](https://www.spill.com), as it has successfully attracted a decent chunk of Black Twitter. And the irony is not lost on me that Jack’s BlueSky, with its invite-only model, has some trouble with diversity (to put it *lightly*). I highlighted Threads, Mastodon, and BlueSky because those three are in this so-called zero-sum game that only one can ultimately win in the microblog realm. Spill could do its own thing and be fine as it flies under the radar. All the disrespect to Post, though. JK.

[^5]: If I’m wrong, and you have an example, please tag me in a toot. If it’s compelling, I’ll include it in my next post.

[^6]: I get it. Mastodon and Threads are not merging into a single platform or company. But this, to me, is the crux of the issue when I observe the discourse on Mastodon. So many of us are so hyper-focused on the technology, we overlook the practical matters of human behavior. And I don’t mean the type of humans who write a README doc for fun. I mean *normal* people (joking). Whether interpolation is technically a “merger” is irrelevant to the average user. In fact, the safest bet for a non-technical user who cannot follow documentation is to assume that Meta *will* use their user data for nefarious purposes. And to be fair, it absolutely will if presented with a sliver of opportunity. Very few of us foresaw what Facebook was doing when we all had like buttons on our blogs for a summer. It’s not impossible for Meta to find a way to monetize Mastodon’s user data. Even if that isn’t its primary objective. 

[^7]: I think Bluesky is set to take a surprising chunk of Twitter users, and I think Jack Dorsey knows it. When TwitterX experiences another mass exodus, Bluesky will open its doors after a comically long invite-only period. The announcement will dominate the news cycle as a companion piece to Twitter’s continued demise. To sweeten the pot, Jack will probably announce a new feature. If you forgot about Bluesky, that’s perhaps by design. It’s ￼biding its time, waiting for someone to slip up. To be clear, I’m not a well-wisher. Dorsey is a fucking dork (derogatory).

[^8]: “You can’t break us up because we’re all connected,” may sound like a dumb excuse, but its the exact [argument Microsoft gave](https://web.archive.org/web/20201109032126/https://www.computerworld.com/article/3277616/microsoft-lost-its-antitrust-suit-almost-two-decades-ago-what-would-be-different-if-it-had-won.html) with Internet Explorer in its anti-trust case.

[^9]: Remember the [TikTok story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/30/facebook-tiktok-targeted-victory/)?

[^10]: While Messenger and Instagram DMs separate, WhatsApp is [gearing up](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/10/23866912/whatsapp-cross-platform-messaging-eu-dma-meta) for third-party chats.
