Just last night I stumbled on [The Small Website Discoverability Crisis](https://www.marginalia.nu/log/19-website-discoverability-crisis/) post while scrolling Hacker News. And here I am tonight, writing a post based on a viral trend with over [150 personal sites](https://defaults.rknight.me/) participating so far. 

*The internet finds a way* (goldblum.gif). 

There's another digital world out there; one buried under the Google SERP and Meta algorithm. But, once you find it, nothing else will do. It's a wonderful place with handcrafted blogs, lingering digital gardens, snarky manifestos (and even snarkier *manifes-don'ts*), and other fantastic internet oddities that you just won't find on even the fifth page of Google. 

Anyway, this trend is dope. I also suddenly feel a little vulnerable about the apps I use. Am I vanilla? *Me*? 

## My default app list

- **Mail Client**: Outlook & Apple Mail
- **Mail Server**: Office 365 & iCloud+
- **Notes**: Notion
- **To-Do**: iOS Reminders or Notion
- **iPhone Photo Shooting**: Camera app
- **Photo Management**: Apple Photos
- **Calendar:** Outlook & Apple Calendar
- **Cloud File Storage:** iCloud + but also kinda Notion?
- **RSS:** [Reeder](https://reederapp.com/)
- **Contacts**: Why? You want my number? Apple Contacts. 
- **Browser:** Safari but slowly testing Arc. 
- **Chat**: Discord 
- **Bookmarks**: Raindrop.io and it gets used *often*. 
- **Read It Later**: Raindrop.io
- **Word Processing**: [iA Writer](ia.net/writer), enthusiastically. 
- **Spreadsheets**: Excel til I die. Also sometimes Airtable. 
- **Presentations:** Just made the switch to [iA Presenter](ia.net/presenter)
- **Shopping Lists**: Reminders but I also have [a wishlist](https://raindrop.io/JayVee/wish-list-34196530) on Raindrop if you want to get me something. 
- **Meal Planning**: gut instincts (but also shout out to [Mela](https://mela.recipes/))
- **Budgeting and Personal Finance**: see meal planning. 
- **News**: Apple News+ and a curated Reeder feed. 
- **Music**: Apple Music (I have Apple One, okay?)
- **Podcasts**: [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/)
- **Password Management**: 1 Password (but looking for recommendations. Hit me on mastodon.)

This was fun. Shout out to [Robb Knight](https://social.lol/@robb/111422346277951738) for cultivating this trend. Happy thanksgiving.
