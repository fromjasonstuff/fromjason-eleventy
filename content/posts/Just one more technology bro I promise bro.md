*just [one more](https://x.com/MidTNDSA/status/1529594847459389440) technology and the world will be a better place, bro, for you and for me, bro.*

From *[How a startup full of ex-iPhone talent is trying to make phones obsolete](https://www.inverse.com/tech/humane-projection-device-ex-apple-employees-artificial-intelligence)*:

> Humane is trying to realize the promise of “ambient computing” — an artificial intelligence-driven computing experience that’s personal and contextual — by building a software platform and hardware line that doesn’t rely on screens.

Go on...


> Humane was founded by Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri, ex-Apple employees who played major roles in the creation of both the iPhone and iPad. 


Two ex-Apple employees who want to make a (presumably) better AI assistant than Siri? Okay, I'm listening...

> At Humane, their stated goal is building technology that's “familiar, natural, and human,” betters the human experience, and is “born from good intentions.” The company believes “we all deserve more from technology,” 

Here it comes...

> Chaudhri also stresses that Humane is focused on “trust and privacy from day zero.” You should have control over what your technology knows, “your data should be owned by you and only you.”

Oh, fuck off lol. 

I'm so tired of the "better tomorrow" promise from snazzy tech start-ups. These "privacy from day zero" promises [cannot be kept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil) in the longterm. Not if they want VC funding. Not if they want to go public. Not if they build their empire on techno-capitalism. 

But please, continue. 

> the company is building screen-free ambient computing hardware, and a platform for it to run on, possibly with **Android** as a starting point...

El Em *Motherfucking* Aye Oh. 

Emphasis mine.
