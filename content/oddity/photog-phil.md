Photog Phil will never let you take a bad picture again. Photog Phil knows your good side. He has a lighting kit in the trunk and he never forgets to set his iPhone to portrait mode.

All Photog Phil asks is you send this page to 10 other people so they may also receive compliments like "You're so photogenic!” Unless you don't want that (haha wink).

Anyway, if you don't forward this to 10 people, Photog Phil will kill your family. Thought I was gonna say something like, "Oh, you'll take bad photos for the rest of your life,” or something, right? Nope. Photog Phill is fucked up, man. I've seen him do it.
